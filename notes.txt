Communication flow:

Enrollment:
(client --> server) <uid> <password>: get secret
(server --> client) authentication failure, please reconnect and enroll
                    OR
                    authentication success, secret is: <secret-text>
Authentication:
(client --> server) <uid> <password>: enroll
(server --> client) enrollment success

The protocol is much simpler now. Make sure that you disallow/replace any spaces
in username or password. Colons also need to be disallowed/replaced.
